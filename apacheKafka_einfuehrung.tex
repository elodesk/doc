\subsection{Persistance}
- disk are fast with linear writes -> example: 7200rpm raid5 ~600MB/s
- operating system read/write ahead
- keep page cache staying warm and store compact byte structure rather than individual objects
- maintaining coherency between the cache and filesystem in the OS
- All data is immediately written to a persistent log on the filesystem without necessarily flushing to disk. In effect this just means that it is transferred into the kernel's pagecache.see also: https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ArchitectNotes
- Instead of  a per-consumer queue with an associated BTree or other general-purpose random access data structures
  a persistent queue could be built on simple reads and appends to files
  This structure has the advantage that all operations are O(1) and reads do not block writes or each other.
- performance is completely decoupled from the data size
- unlimited disk space without any performance penalty means that we can provide some features like retain messages for a relative long period (say a week)



- for each topic a folder
- separate folders over partitions (1;2) -> topic\_0; topic\_1
- file name: offset of the first message it contains (next file: S bytes (max log size, given in configuration) from previous file)
- file format: sequence of log entries
- log entry: N (4 byte integer -> message length) followed by message (N message bytes)
- message: unique identifier (64 bit integer offset -> byte position of the start of this message in the stream of all messages ever sent to that topic on that partition)

On-disk format of a message:

offset: 8 bytes
message length : 4 bytes (value: 1+4+n) 
magic value  : 1 byte
crc            : 4 bytes
payload        : n bytes
    ?:              : 1 byte
    ?:              : 4 bytes
    message length  : 4 bytes
    message         : n bytes
