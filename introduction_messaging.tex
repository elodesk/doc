\chapter{Introduction to Messaging} 

Before we can understand the capabilities of Apache Kafka, we first need to
know how messaging basically works and what a message broker is. Also there are other
important terms related to messaging we want do declare.

\section{What is Messaging?}
A distributed system consists of a collection of multiple autonomous components,
connected through network, which enables to coordinate  (e.g. computers) their
activities and to share resources. To a user, these systems are perceived as a
single, integrated computing facility. Other than centralised systems,
distributed systems has it's advantages in economics, performance and
scalability and reliability. In fact, this approach allows us to build reliable
applications, scaled using low cost computers and thus can serve massive
performance needs whether on demand or continuously.\cite{POSA1}\cite{TAN06}
\todo{gls?}

Although distributed systems have many advantages, compared to local
applications there are a lot of challenges (as mentioned later) that need to be
assumed by developers. Messaging is an approach to deal with such difficulties.
It integrates distributed applications to an overall system by providing message
queues for communication between them. One application can publish its messages
to the queue and another application can asynchronously read from it at any time.
Thereby a message is just a simple and independent unit with a data structure
which contains a meta header and the transmitted information. The messaging
technology enables high-speed, asynchronous, program-to-program communication
with reliable delivery.

\newpage
Peter Deutsch originally defined fundamental fallacies of distributed computing
which still are relevant today.\cite{fallaciesOfDs} Messaging
simplifies the development of distributed systems by mainly facing the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{Fallacy: The network is reliable} \hfill \\
        There are always a plenty of things that can go wrong in a network
       like power failures, bad connectivity or natural disasters. Therefore a
       network must never be seen as fail-safe. One always have to assume
       that sent data possibly getting lost on the wire. A messaging system
       runs with an underlying middleware (\ref{intro-messaging-mom})
       which deals with failures on each side of the communication. This allows to
       get control of which messages has been successfully delivered and which
       need to be redelivered.In normal case the original sender never has the
       guarantee that the sent message has arrived at the desired destination
       but it always has the confirmation of the middleware that the data has put in a
       message queue. In case of failure the messaging system can initiate
       appropriate actions to delegate a failed transmission.}   
    \item{\textbf{Fallacy: Bandwidth is infinite and the Latency is zero } \hfill \\
        Communicating over network is significant slower than local operations.
        A distributed system has to deal with delays and interruptions of any
        length. Messaging supports a storage capacity which leads to a
        persistent way of communication where it is not required that the
        collaborating endpoints are active during the entire transmission of a
        message. This loose coupling in time is achieved by working with queues
        as data structure (first-in-first-out).
        }
    \item{\textbf{Fallacy: Topology doesn't change} \hfill \\
        Applications, systems and topologies changes over time, and in most
        scenarios these often affects the collaborating components in the
        distributed network too. Therefore distributed nodes should be decoupled as
        far as possible. In messaging this is also achieved with the underlying
        middleware.(\ref{intro-messaging-mom}) The sender and receiver do not
        communicate do not need to know them directly. They always communicate
        via the middleware software. In case of significant changes, only the
        interface to the messaging system needs to be updated. }
    \item{\textbf{Fallacy: The network is homogeneous}\hfill \\
        In real world, application are always different. In distributed systems
        data need to be transmitted between nodes which use different
        programming languages, operating platforms, and data formats.
        This is called interoperability\todo{gls}  which actually means that
        systems based on different technologies can collaborate together by using
        the same standard or protocols. Messaging provides either a common
        interface or protocol on the wire which can be implemented from various
        applications. While using a messaging system in an
        enterprise environment it is much more efficient to integrate a new
        application to the existing data flow. Instead of implementing a new
        interface for another technology, the additional software can be just
        linked to the existing platform by using the underlying messaging
        protocol.\\

        In the past, several companies like IBM or Microsoft developed their own
        proprietary standards and protocols for asynchronous messaging systems.
        Probably to keep it locked in their customer base. In June 2001 the Java
        Message Service API (JMS) was released as best-known standard for
        messaging systems. However, it is only an interface an not a specific
        protocol, JMS implementations need to define their own. There was still
        no general protocol standard which would have allowed to interoperate
        between different messaging implementations. Fortunately in June 2006 a
        pool of multiple companies for network technologies defined the Advanced
        Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) as a open standard for an interoperable
        messaging protocol. \cite{PrpAMQP}

\section{Message Oriented Middleware}
\label{intro-messaging-mom}
Because networks are not inherently reliable, messaging would be inefficient
without a systems that manages the capabilities of messaging by acting as
mediator. Introducing an intermediate component between distributed applications, messaging
reduces the close coupling of other communication styles just based on
\gls{Socket}s or RMI. This additional component can be named as messaging system
or message-oriented middleware (MOM) and is all about passing \gls{Msg}s in any
format from one application to another whereas the parties do not need to knows
each other directly. \cite{TAN06}
The MOM provides a specific API for both the sender as well for the receiver:
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Put}    & Append a message to a specific queue                                        \\ \hline
\textbf{Get}    & Block until the specific queue is nonempty, and remove the first message    \\ \hline
\textbf{Poll}   & Check a specific queue for messages, and remove the first                   \\ \hline
\textbf{Notify} & Install a handler to be called when a message is put into a specified queue \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Basic API for message queue implementation \cite{TAN06}}
\end{table}

In a basic scenario with a application A as sender of a message and a
application B as receiver, the MOM ---running either on the node itself or
dedicated in the local network--- assumes the task of handling a local queue for
messages and manages an address-lookup database for mapping destination names to
network locations. The sender first packs its data into the appropriate
message format (1) and puts its message in his local queue (2). The MOM then
delivery the message over the network to the queue of the receiver (3). In turn the
receiver system can get the incoming message from its own local queue (4) and
unpack it to finally get the transmitted data (5).

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/mom-schema.png}
    \caption{Schematic flow of communication in a basic messaging system }
    \label{fig:message-oriented-middleware}
\end{figure}

\section{Topologies}
\subsection{Point-To-Point Connection}
\label{intro-messaging-pointtopoint}
A point-to-point connection is the simplest architecture for communicating in a
messaging system. It ensures that only one node receives a specific message by
setting up particular connections between the nodes. This kind of
communication works well in an environment with only a few systems which want to
collaborate and use the advantages of messaging. But if there are more
nodes, the local mapping of a queue name to a foreign network location
implies that each system needs to hold the addresses of all the other nodes that it
wants to communicate with. When a target address changes, all the applications that
communicate with the changed target must be updated. 

In most scenarios there is also a need for transforming messages to different
format where these implementations have to be made on every node, which leads to
duplicating code. In an architecture with many collaborating applications
point-to-point messaging can end up in a mess of connection which is hard to
maintain.  For more complex integration solutions, a centralised solution
whereas the MOM runs on a location independent platform is required. This is
where the central hub (broker) comes into game. \cite{MSDNIntegration}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/point-to-point-messaging.png}
    \caption{Mess of multiple point-to-point connections}
    \label{fig:point-to-point-messaging}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Central Hub (Message Broker)}
\label{intro-messaging-broker}
A messaging system with point-to-point connections can decouple two systems
by using a managed queue on each side of a collaboration. But there is
still the need of configuration the endpoints on each side. In general, a
message broker is a dedicated component which decouples source and
target systems by assuming full responsibility for coordinating communication between
all connected nodes. Thereby the main tasks of a message broker are the
dynamically registration of endpoints, determining location of target system
(a.k.a. routing) and performing of the communication as well transformation of a
message from one format to another.\cite{MSDNIntegration} \\

    \label{fig:central-hub}
\end{figure}

%Hinweis: In der Literatur wird der hier genannte Broker oft in zwei
%verschiednen topoligien angeschaut: Bus und Broker, wobei der Broker lediglich
%für Transformation von Mesage zuständig ist. Die genaue Definition ist jedoch
%schwammig und unterscheided sich von Produkt und Hersteller. Deshalb fassen wir
%die Funktionalität von Bus und Broker zusammen zu Broker

\section{Message Broker in Detail}
\subsection{The Broker Pattern }
As initial point for the detailed definition of a message broker we take the
\textit{Broker Pattern} of  \textit{Patterns of Software Architecture Volume1}
which can be used to structure distributed systems with decoupled components.
Basically it differs between two types of brokers, where the \textit{Direct
Broker} performs a initialization of a connection but the following communication
is only between the two endpoints. For messaging, the second variant
\textit{Indirect Broker}, is lot more interesting because it maintains all of
the communication between the nodes at every time. So let us define the message
broker as refinement of the Indirect Broker Pattern for message-based
communication.\cite{POSA1} 

%\subsection{Structure}
The \textit{Broker Pattern} consists of five types of participating components,
which we can adapt for a message based environment by using the common terms.

\begin{description}
    \item[Producer (adapted from Client component)] \hfill \\
        {Applications that either generating data for later processing or
        accessing a service from another client in the messaging system. In both
        cases the producer pushes its messages to the broker and in general don't care 
        about it anymore.}
    \item[Producer API (adapted from Client-Side-Proxy)] \hfill \\
        {Structural component which encapsulates messaging-specific
        functionality from the rest of the client code. Thereby, a call from the producer
        can be transformed to a message in the right format. The producer API
        directly communicates with the broker API.}
    \item[Broker] \hfill \\
        {Central component that acts as a mediator and is responsible for the
        transmission of messages from multiple producers to multiple consumers.
        A broker offers an API to the messaging clients, both for consumer and
        producer. It also must have kind of a directory for locating registered
        consumers.} 
    \item[Consumer (adapted from Server component)] \hfill \\
        {Basically the consumer is a endpoint which receives and processes a
            message for further activities. An \textit{Event-Driven-Consumer}
            handles incoming messages automatically as they are pushed from the
            broker. A \textit{Polling-Consumer} explicitly gets messages when it
            wants to receive it from the broker. If a consumer provides a
            service to other clients, it also can act as a producer for sending
            back messages as response.}
\item[Consumer API (adapted from Server-Side-Proxy)] \hfill \\
        {Structural component which encapsulates messaging-specific
        functionality from the rest of the client code. Based on incoming
        messages it calls services within the consumer component. }
\end{description}

\subsection{Consumption Model}
A fundamental design decision of a message broker is whether consumers
    should pull data from brokers or brokers should push data to consumers. This
    has direct impacts to the performance of a broker system whereas in a
    push-based environment the consumers can be the bottleneck when its
    consumption rate falls below the rate of production. In a pull-based system
    consumers which fall back can catch up at any time whereas the risk of
    bottleneck lies at the broker thus a message broker should scale well. On
    the other hand in a pull-based environment a consumer never knows whether a
    message is ready for consumption or not. In worst case this ends up with a
    read loop where the consumer constantly need to check the queue.

%We saw that a \textit{Broker} acts like a mediator between to collaborating
%applications which do not need to know each other. The same does a message
%broker, of course in a message-oriented distributed system whereas the broker
%handles incoming messages from a source to a target and backwards.

%In such an environment it is essential that existing and new applications can be
%integrated into a single, coharent system at runtime. Often these applications
%are not speaking the same language and it need kind of a gateway for
%transforming messages into a format that can be unterstood by the receiver.

%\subsection{Publish-Subscribe}
\subsection{Topic and Subscription Model}
\label{intro-messaging-publishsubscribe}
Message Broker systems are persisting incoming messages in an enhanced type of a
message queue, namely topic. A topic allows the broker to deliver a message to
multiple independent consumers. Sending messages to the broker in form of
publishing to a specific topic and on the other hand receiving messages only for
the specified topic, is called publish/subscribe. In contrast to a one-to-one
queue, the message broker requires the abilities to match messages on an
application based level to act as a gateway for topic related messages. Based on
the informations provided within the messages, the broker is being able to
provide the messages to the client acting as a subscriber. In fact,
this publish/subscribe queue delivers a copy of the topic related messages to
the output channel. This also means that there can be more than one client that
consumes the topic specific
messages and thus there can be more than one subscriber. Especially this feature
of having multiple consumers of a message channel, is decisive for using a
message broker in environment where we want to process the same stream of
data in multiple ways. We will go in deeper detail to stream processing in the
following chapter. \cite{EIP03} \cite{TAN06}

    \label{fig:topic-subscription}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reliable Delivery}
A reliable delivery of messages can promise a specific behaviour to producer
    and consumer. A message broker typically supports one ore more of the
    following guarantees.
    \textit{At most once} guarantees that messages may be lost but are never
    redelivered. \textit{At least once} is defined that messages are never lost
    but may be redelivered. The \textit{Exactly once} semantic which is very
    typical guarantees that each message is delivered only once. Broker system
    which use the \textit{In Order} semantic deliver messages to the consumer in
    the strict same order they are sent from the producer to the broker. 

\section{Challenges of a Messaging System}
\label{intro-messaging-characteristics}
As described a messaging system has its strengths in interoperability and louse
coupling of distributed computers. 
%Messaging löst also gewisse Schwierigkeiten von Distributed System bring aber
%selber neue Challenges auf: 
A message broker in turn has also many further
characteristic where we have described the most related to our work as follows:  

\begin{description}
    \item [Independence] \hfill \\
    { Independence to specific technologies or systems. The more independent a
        message broker is, the better it can be integrated in a existing
        environment. The use of standards and effective standardized interfaces
        promotes independence.}
    \item [Scalability] \hfill \\
    {Ability to dynamically increase performance depending on work load.  }
    \item [Latency]\hfill \\
    {Elapsed time it takes to process a single message for consumption.  }
\item [Fault Tolerance] \hfill \\
        {Ability to recovery after a failure with minimal message loss.
            Possibility to build redundancy through clustering\todo{gls} and
            replication strategy such as master slave\todo{gls} or state machine
            replication\todo{gls}. It is a significant characteristic how a
            message broker syncs its replications and elect which of the nodes
            to get active if the master fails. Also it is important that in case
            of failure the system can recover as quickly as possible and with
            minimal throughput deficit.   }
        \item [Persistency] \hfill \\ 
        {Ability to offer durable and persistent messages although the broker
            systems restarts, crashes or consumer is inactive for longer period of time
            (for instance batch processing system). }
    \item [Throughput] \hfill \\
        {Proportion of messages which can be sent to a broker to the amount of
        messages which can be consumed in a fixed time interval.}
\end{description}
