\chapter{Introduction to Stream Processing}

\section{What is Stream Processing?}
- Definition: A stream is a sequence of unbounded tuples of the form (a1, a2,
... an, t) generated continously in time. ai=attribut, t=time

- Stream processing = processing data before storing. Batch systems like hadoop
provide processing after storingS- Sream processing = processing data before
storing. HBatch sstems like hadoop provide processing after storing  

- a stream processing system is built out of multiple units called a processing
elemen (PE). Each PE receive input from their input queues, does some
computation on the input using its local state and produce output to their
output queues. PE communicate always through messaging with other PEs.

- Most important attributes which however are competing each other : (low)
Latency of the system and high availability. High availability by recovering
from failures is critical for a Stream processing system - recovery should be
fast and efficient. Data should partitioned and handled in parallel for large
volumes of data. The partitioning strategy of a system  affects how the system
handles the data in paralell and how the system can scale. 

\subsection{Stream sources}
-From traditional PCs and Smartphones to a lot of sensors who are connected to
the interne -> Internet of Things!

\section{(Distributed) Stream processing systems}

\section{Real-time Processing}
- Zitat: involves a continual input, proccess and output of data. Data must be
processed in a small time period (or near real-time). 
- allows organization the ability to take immediate action for those times when
acting within secons or minutes is significant\\

- Zitat: Storm is an open source distributed Real time computation system that
processes streams of data. Hadoop MapReduce processes jobs in batch while
Storm processes streams in near real time. The idea is to reconcile real time
and batch processing when dealing with large data sets. An example is detecting
transaction fraud in near Real time while incorporating data from the data
warehouse or hadoop clusters.\\

\section{Complex event processing (CEP)}
In literatur there is often a confusion about the difference between the terms
complex event processing and stream event processing. Both systems work on
events and produce results based on the properties of the events... 
- Zitat: Combines data from multiple sources  to detect patterns and attempt to
identify either opportunities or threats. The goal is to identify significant
events and respond fast. Sales leads, orders or customer service calls are
examples.\\


\section{Batch processing}
- Processing data after storing 
-Zitat: Processing hight volumes of data is where a group of transaction is collected
over a period of time. Data is collected, entered, processed and the batch
result are produces. -> Real-time virtually impossible
- Apache Hadoop\\
- Data to be stored and analyzed by the batch processing system to get a deeper
understanding and discovering patterns
