\chapter{Motivation} 

In distributed systems and the involved technologies, a significant amount of
terms and definitions have been given in the literature. The first part of this
preparatory study aims to achieve more clarity in this confusing and oftentimes
ambiguous \textit{jungle of terminology}, where the focus lies on topics that
are related to Apache Kafka. After defining basic concepts for referencing
during this thesis, we go deeper into the technology and components of Apache
Kafka itself. Finally we compare other implementations of similar systems
whereas the goal of this survey is to uncover the differences of the most
related alternatives in contrast to Apache Kafka. \\
