\chapter{Introduction to Distributed Systems}

A distributed system consists of a collection of multiple autonomous components, connected through network, which enables to coordinate their activities and to share the resources. To a user, these systems are perceived as a single, integrated computing facility \cite{TAN06}. Other than centralised systems, distributed systems has it's advantages in economics, performance and scalability, inherent distribution and reliability \cite{POSA1}.

\section{Broker Pattern}

Different patterns were introduced related to distributed systems The most relevant to build a fully-fledged message broker system proves to be the \textit{Broker pattern} which can be used to structure distributed systems with decoupled components \cite{POSA1}.
