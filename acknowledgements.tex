Many thanks to our supervisor Prof Dr. Josef M. Joller, who provided us the
opportunity to perform a thesis which is about programming a real world
application in Haskell. It was our desire to invest time in learning this
functional programming language as it has never been an essential part of our
studies.  By including messaging and Apache Kafka as basic conditions, he
defined a very interesting and challenging intent for our thesis. He motivated
us to work hard on the given goals.

Many thanks to our expert Dr. Simon Meier, who also was our contact for Haskell
specific questions. We are thankful for his inputs related to our code
especially the detailed code review he performed. We were very pleased that he
gave us the opportunity to participate at the ZuriHac and thus to get in touch
with other Haskell experts.
