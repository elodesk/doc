Many thanks to our supervisor Prof Dr. Josef M. Joller, who provided us the
opportunity to perform a thesis which is about programming a real world
application in Haskell, due it was our desire to invest time in learning this
functional programming language. By including messaging and Apache Kafka as
basic conditions, he defined a very interesting and challenging
intent for our thesis. He motivated us to work hard on the given goals.

Many thanks to our expert Dr. Simon Meier, who was our contact point for Haskell
specific questions. We are thankful for his inputs related to our code
especially the detailed code review he performed. We were also very pleased that
he gave us the opportunity to participate at the ZuriHac to get in touch with
further experts.
