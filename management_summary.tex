\chapter{Management Summary}

\section{Introduction}

This thesis aims to adapt the concept of Apache Kafka and build a messaging
system, namely Haskell Message Broker (HMB), in the functional programming
language Haskell. Thereby the focus lies on the implementation of a stable
(related to networking) server application system as well as on the building a
log subsystem, which in Apache Kafka is considered to be the most important
feature. As Kafka comes with its own wire-protocol a part of this thesis will
focus on a fully compatible implementation of the Apache Kafka Protocol in
Haskell, including a client library allowing Haskell applications to take use of
the protocol implementation and communicate with Apache Kafka or HMB.

\section{Approach}

\section{Results}

\section{Outlook}

- broker results promissing
- very extendable/scalable implementation base and architecture
- with further work one could build the current prototype to an extraordinary
broker system.

As for now, the highlight remains the protocol implementation which has already
been praised by the Haskell community and found its contributors they helped
uncovering minor issues.
